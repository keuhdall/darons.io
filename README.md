# darons.io : determine your "daddisation" level

## Stupid project I made during the confinement. My first ever frontend project. Yep, that was painful.

## The story
I was regularly speaking with a friend of mine on discord and we came to realise that as time goes by we're doing more and more "dad things" and less and less "youngsters things". We were joking about it and decided to give name to that process and called it "daronisation" (roughly translated as "daddisation", or "boomerisation"). The joke then went a bit too far and we decided to create a test to evaluate your "daronisation" level, which eventually ended up being this website.

## The ranks
There is currently 6 ranks, which are the following:
|        Rank name      | Daronisation %age required  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ultimate Boomer       | >= 90%                      |
| Boomer                | >= 75%                      |
| Aspiring Daron        | >= 60%                      |
| Young Grandpa         | >= 45%                      |
| Timidly Old           | >= 30%                      |
| Degenerate Millenial  | < 30 %                      |

## Building the project
Requirements:
- Node >= 15.0
- Yarn

Simply run `yarn install` and let the JS ecosystem do its madness and download petabytes of garbage on your HDD.

Done ? Simply run `yarn start` in a terminal, and `yarn serve` in another one.

Now go `localhost:8080` and you'll see my awful website


## Contributing
Feel free to open an issue if you've got some ideas of questions that could be added. Please note that I won't add EVERY questions as I already got many requests for that and the tests is already pretty long.

If you wanna actively contribute to the codebase please do ! :pray: As I said it's my first ever frontend project  and any help to make this better will be greatly appreciated as my frontend knowledge is pretty much nonexistent.



## Q&A
> **Q**: Why did u do dis ? **A**: Why not ? Seemed fun and I'm bored during this never-ending confinement.

> **Q**: I don't speak french and I don't understand a thing of what you wrote on that goddamn website!!1 **A**: Hey that's not a question. I wasn't expecting any non-french-speaker on that website I must say. If you want me to translate the content create an issue and I might give it a try if I'm not too lazy. It'll be a good opportunity to learn about i18n.

> **Q**: Why does your code sucks so much ? **A**: Because I've never done frontend before and while ReasonML is a lot of fun, everything around it is just annoying as f*ck, seriously, wtf is wrong is CSS ? And webpack ??

> **Q**: Why didn't you write any unit test u lazy fck ? **A**: Cuz Im lazy and I suck, sorry :(

> **Q**: Why using that weird-ass language that no-one uses and not just do good'ol'JS/TS ? **A**: I'm really passionate about FP and I want to use it as much as possible. ReasonML is a really cool language and I enjoyed using it to do this project.
